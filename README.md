## Problem Analysis

Given that you want to learn the basics of algebra, a Flask application can be designed to provide interactive lessons, quizzes, and a progress tracker to help you achieve your goal.

## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

- **Homepage (index.html)**: This page serves as the entry point for the users. It provides an overview of the application, including its purpose and features. It also offers navigation links to the lessons, quizzes, and progress tracker.
- **Lessons (lessons.html)**: This page presents the algebraic lessons. It includes interactive content, such as videos and diagrams, along with text explanations. Each lesson has a "Mark as Complete" button that users can click to track their progress.
- **Quizzes (quizzes.html)**: This page displays quizzes that users can take to test their understanding of the lessons. Quizzes are randomized to ensure a fair and varied assessment. Users can see their results immediately after completing the quizzes.
- **Progress Tracker (progress.html)**: This page displays the user's progress throughout the lessons and quizzes. It shows the completion status of each lesson and the user's average score in the quizzes.

### Routes

- **Homepage Route (/)**: This route renders the homepage (index.html).
- **Lessons Route (/lessons)**: This route renders the lessons page (lessons.html).
- **Quizzes Route (/quizzes)**: This route renders the quizzes page (quizzes.html).
- **Progress Tracker Route (/progress)**: This route renders the progress tracker page (progress.html).
- **Mark Lesson as Complete Route (/mark-lesson-complete)**: This route handles the request to mark a lesson as complete. It updates the user's progress in the database.
- **Submit Quiz Route (/submit-quiz)**: This route handles the submission of a quiz. It evaluates the user's answers and provides them with their score.

The application will store the user's progress and quiz results in a database.

## Conclusion

This Flask application design provides a structured and interactive way for you to learn the basics of algebra. It offers engaging lessons, quizzes, and a progress tracker to monitor your understanding and progress. You can easily implement this design using Python Flask and start your journey towards mastering algebra.
